# Kattis


## Description

This repository serves as an archive of all the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) problems that I've sovled.

## Motivation

I mainly use Kattis as a learning tool for new programming languages that exite me. This is mainly why there are multiple programming languages used in the solutions. 



## Helpful tools


- [Kitty](https://github.com/avborup/kitty) is a CLI tool to make working with Kattis projects a breeze
- [kitty_cargo](../kitty_cargo) is a shell function to make Kitty work with Cargo projects, to enable `rust_analyzer` to work
