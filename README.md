# Kattis


## Description

This repository serves as an archive of all the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) problems that I've sovled.

## Motivation

I mainly use Kattis as a learning tool for new programming languages that exite me. This is mainly why there are multiple programming languages used in the solutions.
